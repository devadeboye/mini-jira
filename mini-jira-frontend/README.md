This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Set up your environment variables:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This will create a `.env.local` file with the necessary environment variables including a secure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`.

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Authentication

This project uses NextAuth.js v5 for authentication with the following features:

- Credentials-based authentication
- JWT session management

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required:

- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: A random secret for JWT signing (auto-generated)
